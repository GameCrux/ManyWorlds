Average hits calculator for Maplestory.

Dynamic programming scheme to compute the multiplicity function for each character-monster match-up. Current version runs through all monsters on a ~v25(?) monster database and displays most efficient monsters to kill in order. Profit ordering considers market price of all monster drops (scroll drops =1 meso for example). Very incomplete GUI, lacking robustness. Calculator working only for very limited number of classes and skills.
